# Linux-Users-Groups-CRUD

**Linux-Users-Groups-CRUD** is a **Python** script that can be used to add, remove & append Users & Groups (CRUD).
This is done by importing the "sys" library allowing us to execute shell commands inside the python script.

You can take a look at the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/Osama-Yusuf/Linux-Users-Groups-CRUD).

## Features

* Create or Delete Users
* Create or Delete Groups
* Append Users to a Certain Group

## Getting started

Download the solo script and give it execution permission using this command: (Recommended)

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Osama-Yusuf/Linux-Users-Groups-CRUD/main/user-group-solo.py" -o user-group-solo.py && chmod +x user-group-solo.py
```

or

You can clone the whole repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osama-Yusuf/Linux-Users-Groups-CRUD.git
```

Then enter repo folder and give the execution permission to the script:

```bash
cd Linux-Users-Groups-CRUD && chmod +x user-group.py
```

And if instead you want to use the solo file:

```bash
cd Linux-Users-Groups-CRUD && chmod +x user-group-solo.py
```

## Usage

First copy it to the binaries folder to run it as a command without the extension (.sh)

### Note that you cannot copy this script to /bin and run it as a program without extension (.sh) 
### So it's recommended that you give permission and copy the solo file to the /bin/ like:

```
sudo cp user-group-solo.py /usr/bin/user-group
```

You can delete the script now if you want.

```
rm -f user-group-solo.py
```

Now you can execute the script in two ways:

First: (Recommended)

```
user-group
```

Second:

```
python3 user-group.py
```
